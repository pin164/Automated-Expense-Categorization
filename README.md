# Automated-Expense-Categorization

develop an automated system that categorizes business expenses from accounts payable transaction history

## Project Overview

The Automated Expense Categorization System aims to streamline the bookkeeping process and enhance financial analysis accuracy for businesses by automating the categorization of business expenses based on accounts payable transaction history. This project addresses the inefficiencies and errors inherent in manual expense categorization and leverages machine learning (ML) to predict the appropriate Cost Centre for invoice approval, ultimately reducing time spent on administrative tasks and increasing the efficiency and accuracy of the financial reporting process.

## Problem Statement

Finance teams spend significant time categorizing expenses manually, leading to:

* Time-consuming processes
* Prone to human error
* Inefficiencies in financial reporting
* Delayed decision-making

As outlined in the use case: If an accounting clerk is responsible for processing 10,000 transaction lines per year, with an average of 12 minutes per line, reducing the processing time by 25% (to 9 minutes per transaction) could lead to annual savings of $12.5K. By automating the categorization process, the clerk would also have more time to focus on analyzing financial data, resulting in better decision-making and financial insight.
